This project was made in a day. 
<br/>
The goal was to complete the exercice of Mathias Gilles about the 11/06/2025 Symfony course, and show that we understood the subject. 
<br/>
Here is the exercice: https://github.com/MathiasGilles/eval_iim_symfony
<br/>
I completed every User Stories and every bullet point. For the Bonus i only did the Fixture one.
